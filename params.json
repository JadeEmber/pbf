{"name":"PBF","tagline":"Position based fluid simulation.","body":"Position Based Fluids\r\n=====================\r\nDependencies\r\n------------\r\n - GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/)\r\n - glm (http://glm.g-truc.net/)\r\n - libpng (http://libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)\r\n - cmake (http://www.cmake.org/)\r\n - _optional_: doxygen (http://doxygen.org/)\r\n\r\nCompiling\r\n---------\r\nCreate a build directory and use the following commands to compile the project:\r\n\r\n\tcmake [path to source directory]\r\n\tmake\r\n\r\nThis will create the executable `src/pbf`. Note that it has to be executed with the\r\nsubdirectories _shaders_ and _textures_ in its working directory. This documentation\r\ncan be generated with `make doc`.\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n----------\r\nThis position based fluids implementation is based on the following scientific paper:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.matthiasmueller.info/publications/pbf_sig_preprint.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore techniques from the following papers have been used:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sci.utah.edu/~csilva/papers/cgf.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://beowulf.lcs.mit.edu/18.337-2008/lectslides/scan.pdf\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.download.nvidia.com/presentations/2010/gdc/Direct3D_Effects.pdf\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nMore extensive documentation than the current doxygen generated reference will be\r\navailable shortly.\r\n\r\nDemonstration videos of a former version of the implementation can currently be\r\nfound at (they were recorded using a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 Ti):\r\nhttp://mokaga.userpage.fu-berlin.de/pbfvids/\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
